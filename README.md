# DEEP-LEARNING-FOR-ACCURATE-POTHOLE-DETECTION-AND-REPAIR-COST-ANALYSIS
This project implements a computer vision-based pothole detection system using YOLOv4-Tiny. It is designed to process both images and videos, detect potholes in real time, and generate results with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
